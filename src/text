Develop a Facebook post component!
https://dummyjson.com/products

Tasks

1. Use the above dummy API to fetch data
2. Create a Facebook post styled component which takes an object as a prop and returns a Facebook post as shown in the attached image
3. Pass the dummy API data into the component inside the map function to render all the data
   develop the component to use these fields with the same design as Facebook posts or think for another unique and stunning design.
   Also add hover functionality on the likes button which shows 5 different emojis

What else left after the above things, we'll implement in future assignments!
This will enable you to provide your components to other developers, they'll just need to add an object and magically your component will return a Facebook post feature!
Basically, I'm moving you guys to develop a library!
